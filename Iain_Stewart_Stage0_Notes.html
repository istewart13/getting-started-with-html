<p><b>How The Web Works</b></p>
The <em>world-wide web</em> (www) is a collection of computers that communicate with each other over a very wide area. The internet uses a protocol called <em>HTTP</em> to communicate with you, your browser and servers. When a user enters a website their computer sends an <em>HTTP request</em> to a <em>server</em> (computers that host the files that make up the web), which then finds and returns the relevant files. The user’s <em>web browser</em> then uses the returned files to display content to the user.

<p><b>HTML</b></p>
HTML stands for <em>HyperText Markup Language</em>.  HTML documents make up most of the content on the web. They can contain <em>text content, markup, references to other documents (images, videos etc) and links to other pages</em>. HTML documents are made up of HTML <em>elements</em>, this refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
 
<p><b>HTML Tags</b></p>
Markup consists of <em>tags</em>, which can also be nested. Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag.

<p><b>Computers Are Stupid</b></p>
They cannot think for themselves and need to be told what to do very precisely by the programmer. The interpret instructions very literally and so simple errors, such as a missing “>” in a tag, can cause a program not to run correctly. Programmers therefore need to write <em>exactly</em> the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").

<p><b>Inline vs Block Elements</b></p>
HTML elements are either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
